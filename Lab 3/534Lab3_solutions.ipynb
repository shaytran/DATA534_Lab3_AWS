    "In this lab you will be called to interact programmatically with Amazon's AWS cloud platform. The choice of the platform is to a certain extent arbitrary (many competitors offer similar services), yet AWS still seems to be a standard goto in many companies. More importantly, the skills that you will acquire in dealing with AWS are also useful when approaching the alternatives.\n",

    "Resources:\n",
    "- I strongly advise you to read [this datacamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/aws-ec2-beginner-tutorial), though do not start a Windows instnace like the tutorial suggests. We will be using Linux.\n",
    "- If you have a couple hours, you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFdBD3YdLJc&feature=youtu.be) which is a great introductory lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- **Windows users** (recommended but not required): For this lab it might be worthy for you to install the Linux subsystem for Windows (see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)). As for the distribution, I suggest you to go with Ubuntu 18. Doing that you can connect with your AWS server just with one line in the linux bash (in fact, it is also possible doing the same thing with powershell, except it is a bit trickier to define permissions in Windows - I can try to help you if you want. Alternatively, you can use [PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).)"
